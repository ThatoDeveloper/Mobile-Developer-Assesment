# Mobile-Developer-Assesment
a simple react-native application using redux
•	3 views that can navigate between each other
•	1 of those views must contain some form of input where data is captured and state kept (and displayed) between each of the views
o	E.g. Welcome view where a user has to input their name. This can then be displayed in the top right of every other view for the session.
•	1 of those views must contain 4 variations of a button shown in the design. The last variation of a button should provide slide event to perform action.  
•	A native module integration leveraging the bridge that checks on startup whether the app is running on an emulator/simulator. If so, display a notice to the user. The notice message text and styling should be configurable through JS.
